                        <h1>Nike Free Sneaker Series</h1>
                        <h2>The Nike Free series is a line of minimalist running shoes designed to promote natural foot movement and flexibility. Introduced in 2005, the series was inspired by Nike-sponsored track athletes training barefoot. Here are key features and developments:</h2>

                                <li>Anatomy-inspired design: Nike Free shoes are shaped to fit the natural contours of the foot, providing a snug and comfortable fit.</li>
                                <li>Flexible materials: From top to bottom, the shoes feature flexible materials that allow for a wide range of motion, mimicking the natural movement of the bare foot.</li>
                                <li>Laser-siped flex grooves: The outsole has grooves that release stiffness in the foam, enabling the shoe to move naturally with the foot.</li>
                                <li>Cushioning system: The numbering system, ranging from 0 (barefoot) to 10 (normal running shoe), indicates the level of cushioning. However, this system was retired in 2016 and reintroduced in 2019 with the RN 5.0 and RN 3.0 models.</li>
                                <li>Current models: The Free series currently consists of two models: RN 5.0 and RN Flyknit 3.0.</li>
